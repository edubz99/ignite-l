          I am Dr Thanda Mhlanga and was raised under the guiding philosophy of
          <strong> ubuntu</strong>, a Nguni term that holds deep personal
          significance. Ubuntu embodies the essence of humanity towards others -
          being present, affirming, and supportive.

          It is rooted in values such as social justice, fairness, duty of care,
          compassion, allyship, goodwill, civility, respect, and dignity. These
          principles are vital for cultivating a compassionate, inclusive, and
          just organisational culture - one where every employee is visible,
          celebrated, and empowered to be their authentic self, regardless of
          their background.
